# Welcome to the CardGuess-Game

Its a Simple Card Guessing Game. (Version 1)

## How to Play:

  1. At first, You would be seen Three Cards, randomly picked from a Deck. Like this, 

      * Card 1: The Six of Spades. 
      * Card 2: The Three of Diamonds. 
      * Card 3: The Queen of Hearts. 

  2. Put the Bet on any Card of your Choice, by just entering that Card-Number. 
  
  3. After that, the Cards would begin to Swap. Just wait, this would just take a Second. 
     
  4. When it is Done Swapping, Guess where's that Card in which you put the Bet, 
     by entering the Card-Number. 

  5. If you Guess it correctly, You Win. Otherwise, you'll Lose. 

  6. If you Enjoyed! You can Play it Again. 


#### Note:

  * The Probability of picking the Three Cards is Equal. 
  * The Swapping is also Done Randomly with equal amount of Probability. 
  
  * If you are Lucky, Two Same Cards could show up, or even all the Three Cards could be Same 
    (but its Probability is very very Low, which surely would mean that You are One of the Luckiest Person). 
  * Its also possible that the Card just swapped by itself. But don't Worry, they are Swapped Multiple Times.
