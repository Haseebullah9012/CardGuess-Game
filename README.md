#### Note:

  * The Probability of Picking the Cards is Equal (There's no Inequality). 
  * The Swapping is also Done Randomly with equal amount of Probability. 
  
  * If you are Lucky, Two Same Cards could show up, or even all the Picked Cards could be Same 
    (but its Probability is very very Low, which surely would mean that You are One of the Luckiest Person). 
  * Its also possible that the Card just swapped by itself. But don't Worry, they are Swapped Multiple Times, so this won't Happen each Time. 

  * If you'll Lose, your Exact Bet Card Number would be Shown, just in Case, if you dont believe us, or you just desired to know the exact Number.
